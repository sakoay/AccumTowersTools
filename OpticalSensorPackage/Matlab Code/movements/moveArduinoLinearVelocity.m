%% ViRMEn movement function for use with the optical sensor + Arduino + MouseReader_2sensors class setup.
%
%   This function assumes that 4 specific variables have been defined in the vr object, for example
%   by calling the initializeArduinoMouse_2sensors() function in the ViRMEn initialization user code
%   section:
%     1) vr.mr:       A MouseReader_2sensors object
%     2) vr.scaleX:   factor by which to scale dX
%     3) vr.scaleY:   factor by which to scale dY
%     4) vr.scaleA:   factor by which to scale dA
%
%   This motion rule assumes that the sensor measures the displacement of the ball at the mouse's
%   feet as [dX, dY] where dX is lateral and dY is anterior-posterior displacement. The orientation
%   of this displacement vector is interpreted as the rate of view angle change. The linear velocity
%   of the animal in the virtual world is computed by rotating [dX, dY] to the animal's coordinate
%   frame, i.e. a pure dY displacement (dX = 0) corresponds to moving forward/backwards along the
%   current trajectory (as defined by view angle) of the mouse.
%
%   Two different types of gain are supported for view angle velocity, depending on the value of
%   vr.scaleA. The first is a simple linear gain factor, i.e. if vr.scaleA is finite this function
%   will compute:
%       (view angle velocity) = vr.scaleA * vr.orientation / (1 second)
%
%   If vr.scaleA is set to NaN, a qualitatively determined exponential gain is used. This is
%   motivated by the fact that it is physically much more difficult for a mouse to orient its body
%   along large angles while head-fixed on top of a ball, and is therefore unable to make sharp
%   turns when a linear gain is applied (unless the gain is very large, which then makes it
%   impossible for the mouse to reliably walk in a straight line). The following code can be used to
%   visualize the exponential gain function:
%
%     figure; hold on; grid on; xlabel('Orientation (radians)'); ylabel('View angle velocity (rad/s)');
%     ori = -pi/2:0.01:pi/2; plot(ori,ori); plot(ori,sign(ori).*min( exp(1.4*abs(ori).^1.2) - 1, pi ));
%
function velocity = moveArduinoLinearVelocity(vr)

  % Obtain the displacement recorded by one sensor (here the second sensor)
  [~,~,dY,dX]     = vr.mr.get_xy_change();
  dY              = -dY;                            % This is just due to the orientation of the sensor
  vr.orientation  = atan2(-dX*sign(dY), abs(dY));   % Zero along AP axis, counterclockwise is positive

  % Rotate displacement vector into animal's current coordinate frame
  R               = R2(vr.position(4));             % vr.position(4) is the current view angle in the virtual world
  dF              = sqrt(dX^2 + dY^2) * sign(dY);   % Length (including sign for forward vs. backward movement) of displacement vector
  temp            = R * [0; dF];
  dX              = temp(1);
  dY              = temp(2);

  % Apply scale factors to translate number of sensor dots to virtual world units
  velocity(1)     = vr.scaleX * dX / vr.dt;
  velocity(2)     = vr.scaleY * dY / vr.dt;
  velocity(3)     = 0;
  
  % Apply exponential gain function for view angle velocity if vr.scaleA is NaN
  if isnan(vr.scaleA)
    velocity(4)   = sign(vr.orientation) * min( exp(1.4*abs(vr.orientation)^1.2) - 1, pi );
  % Otherwise apply a linear gain
  else
    velocity(4)   = vr.scaleA * vr.orientation;
  end

  % The following should never happen but just in case
  velocity(~isfinite(velocity)) = 0;

  % Send request for the readout to be used in the next iteration
